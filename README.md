## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
Users should be able to:
​
- Recreate a webpage from scrap based off parameters listen or images shown
- Add in necessary features to said webpage
- Deploy created webpage to the internet via GitHub

## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- README markdown

### What I learned
​
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. Honestly thought I had a handle on everything until the night before it was due and things started falling apart. Will focus on the small details of the acceptance criteria moving forward.

### Continued development

I would like to build up the skills learned during this challenge in a way that improves my accuracy in creating a desired webpage to add to a portfolio for future refernces. Flexbox and formating is still something that I would like to improve upon.
​
### Useful resources
​
- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped with overcoming the challenges with flex and getting layout for flexboxes down
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This hard reliable links for tools to help with CSS as many other websites didn't tack as well and conflicted with one another, especially those with problems/solutions
